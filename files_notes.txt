    - !! Many suitable candidates, 
    - Check channel 1 for many more targets!
    - requires imcomplement before histeq
    - bottom left is useless, but many motile cells
    - noisy, cells appear to have "holes"

09:11 (exp).tif  -> DictyElectrotaxis_171109_001_2.tif
    - !! Few suitable targets
    - 3 slow cells centre left, see ch3
    - Motile cell in bottom right, but goes underneath benign cell
    - Motile cell in top left, but enters/exits frame quickly
    - Contrast between cells and background is poor

    - Original clip used for testing (center)
    - !! Good candidates here
    - 3 Motile cells, center, right, and bottom right
        - Bottom right exits frame, but good candidate nonetheless

16:11(02).tif    -> DictyElectrotaxis_171116_002.tif
    - !! Good candidates here
    - 3 motile cells center left
    - clumps bottom left and top right
    - stationary but 'malleable' cell in top left?
