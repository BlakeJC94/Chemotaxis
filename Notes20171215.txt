Notes from meeting 2017/12/15
----------------------------------------------------------------

** Look at more data!! pick out 5 or so cases that characterise the average 
    behaviour of these cells. Test new methods on this suite.


Halt work on current perimeter analysis method in edgedetect, this method 
is not suitable for the irregular polygons these motile cells are usually 
found as. This wont be able to tell us the number of arms we have reliably.


We are left with 2 methods:


1. 'Shapedist' metric
    - Set centroid as origin
        - if centroid is not in region, set origin to be midpoint of 
            closest boundary point and nex closest boundary point 
            in the same direction.
    - Parameterise the boundary as variable 's', and step anticlockwise 
    - For each step, find length of shortest path within shape to origin
    - Number of peaks (w/thrs) will give number of arms

* Can be accomplished by using some sort of distance transform on region
    * Set origin as 0, neighbouring pixels inside shape increase by 1 and 
        neighbouring pixels outside shape are set to -1
* Match corresponding boundary pixels with values in transformed array
* (Will require new methods of array manipulation)


2. Skeletal structures
    - Replace image by skeleton
    - Number of free ends will give number of arms

* Maybe use the bwmorph(I, 'thin', Inf) operation, then use  
    - bwmorph(I,'endpoints') for endpoints,
    - bwmorph(I,'branch') for branch points
    - if cleaning is needed, try running bwmorph(I6,'spur',n) for n times
* number of endpoints a certain distance away from a branching point will 
    give a good measure of the number of arms. 
    * threshold distance can be used to exclude 'bumps' 

* ISSUE: May not work well on regions with random lines coming off it, 
    see later frames in first ROI when contrast between cell interior
    and cell exterior more vague
    * An option to fix this may be to have a persistent skeleton object 
        overlayed? similar to how the centroid to tracked now
        * Indexing each branch my become problematic?


Next meeting in 2018, will remain in email contact in the meantime
